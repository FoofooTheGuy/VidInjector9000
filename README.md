You may ask...
--
**Q: Why did you even make this?**

A: I made this so that the process of injecting with 3D banners is more streamlined.

**Q: How is this different from all the other injectors?**

A: This is simple and gives you much control over your injections.

**Q: Why does it keep throwing errors at my compatible files?**

A: Make sure that there are no spaces in your file paths, apparently computers don't like those...

**Q: Why is there an entire tool for basically just generating a random number?**

A: It's a long story and it could be done in pure batch but I am just more comfortable with C++ than with Batch.
