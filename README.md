You may ask...
--

**Q: Does the input CIA have to be decrypted?**

A: Yes.

**Q: Why does it keep throwing errors at my compatible files?**

A: Make sure that there are no spaces (or any other weird characters) in your file paths. Apparently computers don't like those... (If it continues to throw errors, reinstall the tool)

**Q: Why did you even make this?**

A: I made this so that the process of injecting with 3D banners is more streamlined.

**Q: How is this different from all the other injectors?**

A: This is simple and gives you much control over your injections.
