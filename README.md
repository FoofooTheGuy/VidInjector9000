# VidInjector9000
A cross platform injector for 3DS video CIAs

## Editions
- [VidInjector9002-CLI](https://github.com/FoofooTheGuy/VidInjector9000/blob/main/VidInjector9002-CLI/README.md): The new and improved real deal CLI.
  
  VidInjector9001 walked so VidInjector9002-CLI could run. This is an argument style CLI instead of a live interface. It's also built into one binary, so it can pretty much run on anything as long as you can compile it.
  
- [VidInjector9002.5](https://github.com/FoofooTheGuy/VidInjector9000/blob/main/VidInjector9002.5/README.md): A GUI wrapper for VidInjector9002-CLI.

  It's what VidInjector9002 should have been. Consider this as a round ring with VidInjector9002-CLI as the core. It uses the CLI as its backend, so it can forcibly cancel heavy operations like exporting or extracting archives by just killing the child process.
