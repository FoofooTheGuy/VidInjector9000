**Q: Why did you even make this?**

A: I made this so that the process of injecting with 3D banners is more streamlined. Also, VidInjector9000 2.0 (aka VidInjector9001) can create multi video injects with MultiVidInjector5000!

**Q: How is this different from all the other injectors?**

A: This is simple and gives you much control over your injections.

Building (MinGW)
--
1. Install [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download) to your computer
2. drag VidInjector9001.cpp onto [build.bat](https://github.com/FoofooTheGuy/VidInjector9000/blob/main/VidInjector9000/build.bat) so that it builds it (or run build.bat with VidInjector9001.cpp as the argument)
